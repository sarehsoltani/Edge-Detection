# Edge Detection with OpenCV

This project focuses on implementing various edge detection techniques using OpenCV, specifically Canny, Sobel, and Laplacian, and aims to compare their performance to determine the most effective method.

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to explore different edge detection algorithms available in OpenCV and analyze their effectiveness in identifying edges within images. The primary focus algorithms used in this project are Canny, Sobel, and Laplacian.

## Results
The project results demonstrate the effectiveness of edge detection algorithms based on comparative analysis. The conclusion drawn from the experiment is that Canny provides the most optimal edge detection results among the tested algorithms due to its ability to reduce noise while accurately detecting edges.
